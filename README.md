# ML_Raycast
A study on machine learning in optimization of ray casting

This repository holds my project for the course "Machine learning D" at Aalto University. It contains the project report, as well as the code. Note that running the code will not work as is, you will need the Martian height model from https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/map/Mars/GlobalSurveyor/MOLA/Mars_MGS_MOLA_DEM_mosaic_global_463m, positioned in the same directory.
